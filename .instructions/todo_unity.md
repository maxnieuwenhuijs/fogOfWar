## ðŸŽ® Development Tips for Humans

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start each day by**:
   - Pulling latest changes
   - Reviewing current phase tasks
   - Setting daily goals

2. **Test frequently**:
   - Use Unity Remote for mobile testing
   - Test on actual devices weekly
   - Profile performance regularly

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Comment complex logic
   - Use regions for organization
   - Follow C# naming conventions
   - Keep methods under 30 lines

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Performance**:
   - Don't instantiate/destroy objects frequently
   - Use object pooling for pawns and effects
   - Batch sprite draws

2. **Mobile Specific**:
   - Always test touch input on device
   - Account for different aspect ratios
   - Handle app pause/resume

3. **Networking**:
   - Never trust client input
   - Validate all actions server-side
   - Handle disconnections gracefully
